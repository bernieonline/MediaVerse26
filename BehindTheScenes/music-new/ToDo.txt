progress bar not working for conversion



change error progress bar label text as needed


TO DO LIST
create some boiler plate code

use mediainfo to place more file details in the error file on the server

Video processing has become very slow can only think its the checksum activity

PRIORITIES

Improve what gets displayed on Footer

image keeps going missing for logo
Also need to make more use of heading space

use markdown files for program notes see folder

create a cron job for mysql dump

Deal with dvds

limit image file sizes

search for duplicate locations, remember that drive letter D: exists on 2 computers etc.so if w: runs on different computers its
its the same location but D: is local not networked. I could list all networked drives and use that in my analysis

remember I created a collection field in mediafiledetail records to help


find a way to prevent application log from building up

I can switch between info and CRITICAL level of reporting
info when developing else CRITICAL

if i want to change the name of a media type such as Image to Photo how will I associate all extensions with that type
create a change type option From - To - What complications?


message when a collection is made showing location

document how to create a new collection type eg publishing for PDF


compare collection could return a lot of files. how can I use the output to manage collections
could I colour code items that are listed that only have a file type difference
this would be good because if not a file type difference, its a missing file


incorporate behind the scenes

discog application



database backup done through workbench till I can sort out the code
