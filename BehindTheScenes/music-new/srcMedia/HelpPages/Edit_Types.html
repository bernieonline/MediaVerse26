    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MySql Database Section</strong></h2>
    <p>You will need to view the read_me file for the setup instructions</p>
    
    <p><strong>This is where you can change the default collections and add new ones of your own: Edit Types</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You can Remove a Media Type such as Music or Video or add a new one of your own such as Books</li>
        <li>The software drills down into a selected folder but you can add some folders not in the default list or remove some</li>
        <li>The <strong>Master</strong> type is important. There should normally be only one master set but you can create sub sets. We have defaults of Clone and Secondary but you can change them</li>
        <li>Files are associated with collections through their file extensions. These are all editable</li>
        <li>Once you have set these up how you want them you can make a start on the next Section <strong>Creating</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="highlight">You will need to install MySql from the packages MySqlDump and set up connection details in the env file. Without it you can't move forward</p>
    
    <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>

    <ul>
            <li>A good starting point is to click on the drop down list of items.</li>
            <li>You can the decide whether to add new ones or remove existing ones</li>
            <li>If you dont like the names of the Collection Types such as Video, remove it and add an alternative</li>
            <li>If you do you will need to add all of the extension names that should be associated with that type</li>
            <li>Excluded folder names are specific to your system you can add or remove as needed </li>

    </ul>
