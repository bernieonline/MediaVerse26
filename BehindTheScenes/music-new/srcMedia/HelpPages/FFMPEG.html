    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MediaManager FFMPEG Actions Section</strong></h2>
    <p>This is where we can test and possibly repair video files as well as converting to other formats</p>
    
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>We should begin with the Master File</li>
        <li>Select a file from the master location on the server - When testing for errors</li>
        <li>A txt file will be created on the server in the same folder as the master file listing the main errors as well as media data from MediaInfo</li>
        <li>Not all errors are noticeable on playback so it 's best to try and play it first before you try for a fix</li>
        <li>If you do that you will know where the error is and how severe</li>
        <li>The <strong>Test a Folder</strong> does the same as the above but in batches</li>
        <li>Repairing files can be difficult as audio and video may be affected, the usual approach is to recreate the file as an mp4 with few adjustments</li>
        <li>When repairing files its best to copy the file to be repaired to a temporary location and work on the copy</li>
        <li>The option to view a file details shows any reported errors as well as metadata</li>
        <li>The Video Proc action is Third Party Software featuring AI enhancement but can be vert slow to run </li>
    </ul>
    
   
    
    <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>
    <p>Its best to start slowly and become familiar with the process <strong>Error Files</strong> will be created and you may want to save them .</p>
