    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MediaManager - Create Master records</strong></h2>
    <p>This together with the Creation of Media Records is the heart of the system.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the software is to search for Media files and record their location, The most complete sets will be referred to as  a Master Set, multiple copies are needed as a backup</p>
    <p>Master sets can exist under 3 versions. Master, Clone and Secondary.</p>
    <p>Each Type of Media File can have its own Master Set, eg Video, Music, Image</p>
    <p>A search will be initiated from a folder and the sets of media files discovered will be grouped under a collection name referencing that location with device and datetime details.</p>
    <p>In theory there is no limit to the number of Master Sets that you create. Each will have its own unique name</p>
    <p>The name is stored in the Collection Field. An example would be 'Master:Media:H:/ItunesFLAC2 Complete:2024-12-26 12:43:56'</p>
    <p>Master =  Master Set, Media = Device Name, 'H:/ItunesFLAC2 Complete' = The Folder Location of the Master Set, 2024-12-26 12:43:56 = The Date and Time of Creation</p>
    <p>A different field in the database stores the Media Type.</p>
    <p>Just remember that when using different devices on your home network can result in identical folder names but in different locay=tions, hence the use of the Device Name</p>


    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>First ensure that you are searching for groups of files <strong>As</strong>  a Master set</li>
        <li>Creating Master Sets. This would  normally be done before creating Media Sets, aiming perhaps at three copies in three different locations </li>
        <li>One of the main objectives after creating a Master Sets and a few Media Sets is to compare them looking for stray files that may be missing from the Master</li>
        <li>When running this option a File Explorer window will open and the user will navigate to a folder where the search will begin.</li>
        <li>You will also need to select the Media Type that you want to create. eg Video</li>
        <li>Finally you will need to choose the type of Master. Examples are Master, Clone and Secondary. These are your backup copies so you need to keep them in sync</li>
        <li>On choosing the starting folder, the program will run in the background drilling deeply into your file system.</li>
        <li>The LCD Displays at the top of the page show system resource levels, the start time of the run and in the bottom right corner is a progress bar</li>
        <li>Large data sets can take more than an hour to run but the display will confirm activity</li>
        <li>Once it completes you can examine it in the Reports section</li>
    </ul>
