    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MediaManager - Create Media records</strong></h2>
    <p>This together with the Creation of Master Records is the heart of the system.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the software is to search for Media files and record their location</p>
    <p>A search will be initiated from a folder and the sets of media files discovered will be grouped under a collection name referencing that location with device and datetime details.</p>
   
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>First ensure that you are searching for groups of files <strong>NOT</strong> in a Master set</li>
        <li>Creating Master Sets (A similar process), would normally be done first, aiming perhaps at three copies in three different locations </li>
        <li>One of the main purposes is to identify surplus copies of media files and then take action to either remove, re-organze, synchronize or delete freeing up space and avoiding unneccesary duplication</li>
        <li>To create a collection or multiple collections choose Select Location</li>
        <li>Collections are divided by Media Type. If a search discovers video and Music files two collections will be created, or more for different types</li>
        <li>A File Explorer window will open and the user will navigate to a folder where the search will begin.</li>
        <li>On choosing the folder, the program will run in the background drilling deeply into your file system.</li>
        <li>The LCD Displays at the top of the page show system resource levels, the start time of the run and in the bottom right corner is a progress bar</li>
        <li>Large data sets can take more than an hour to run but the display will confirm activity</li>
        <li>Once it completes you can examine it in the Reports section</li>
    </ul>
