    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MediaManager Tips Section</strong></h2>
    <p>The software that puts you back in charge of your Media Files.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Our default Collections are Video, Music and Image.</li>
        <li>But you can make your own with associated file extensions.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Creating</strong> Option lets you choose a starting folder and the software will drill down and record details of each media file found. The record will have a collection name and other data</li>
        <li>You may be best starting with your master files creation, you can then compare them with your other media collections and keep track of both</li>
        <li>Once done you can decide what to do with your Non Master collections</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="highlight">You will need to install MySql from the packages MySqlDump and set up connection details in the env file.</p>
    
    <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>
    <p>A good starting point is checking out the data lists It's in <strong>Edit Types</strong> in the database section.</p>
    
    <p>Most of the Menu options will show a Tips page like this which may suggest further Help pages</p>
