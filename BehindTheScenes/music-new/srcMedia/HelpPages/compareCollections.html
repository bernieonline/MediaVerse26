    <h2  style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Welcome to the MediaManager - Comparing Collections</strong></h2>
    <p>This section is used to compare 2 sets of records</p>
    
    <p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Initially we establish Master Sets, We only need 3 copies of our master files as long as they are safely backed up.</li>
        <li>Over time with fragmented collections you may have non master sets referred to as media collections, containing files that are not in the master set.</li>
        <li>One purpose of the software is to remove media collections once master sets are established. Before we do that though, we need to test whether any files are contained in the media collection not in the master</li>
        <li>This will help you to update the master before removing the media set</li>
        <li>Just take care here as the system will see different file types as different files</li>
        <li>For example the master file may contain .flac files and the media set .mp3 files</li>
        <li>Once done you can decide what to do with your Non Master collections</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Lets Get Started</h2>
    <p>We begin by identifying the 2 sets that we wish to compare. There are 2 list boxes to select collection names from</p>
    <p>The third list box offers 2 options, select records in B that do not appear in A</p>
    <p>or Select records in A but not in B</p>
    <p>Click the compare button to view the results</p>
    <p>Remember that you can retain as many collections as you like so its ok to keep lower resolution sets if there may be a future need, such as use on a device that has limited storage</p>
